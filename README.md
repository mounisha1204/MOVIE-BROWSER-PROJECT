# MOVIE-BROWSER-PROJECT
The Movie Browser project leverages the power of React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, to create an interactive and dynamic web application focused on movies. It utilizes data from APIs like The Movie Database (TMDb) to fetch information about movies, including their titles, posters, descriptions, ratings, and more.
